# Conclusion

It is clear to see that the definition and construction of a Data Pipeline for an application is the product of a correct and deep analysis, not only because a data product has to follow all the formal phases, but also combine the quality approaches when is building a web app, the user experience is now part of every technological development.  

This is the path Data Scientists have to keep following and to which have been added proposers and that will set the course of a global trend, one might say many of these proposals may inspire people to apply the abstraction of these models on problems of other fields of knowledge.  

Creating a data product is a challenge that few assume but can definitely contribute a lot when it is created with meaning and aim to solve some problem that is left unattended. Once the construction process is started, something that must be taken into consideration is working in an isolated environment in order to guarantee the replicability of the product. Today there are different tools that help a project to be driven as a continuous and multilateral contributed.

Finally, it is important to emphasize that combining Open Science approach with useful Web applications using Data Science, merge to create a very powerful complete weapon that has the ability to attack a wide variety of problems as reviewed in The present document, that is why we must continue to promote this type of studies and continue to ask questions in various fields of science.
